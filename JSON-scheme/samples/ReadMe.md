## Mapping IPTC Knowledge Items to JSON

The XSLT file IPTCki-to-IKOS-JSONscheme-draft.xslt transforms the XML syntax of a Knowledge Item to JSON syntax of the IKOS-schema.

Two transformation examples are available:
* IPTC Media Topics, about 1100 topics in a hiearchical tree: KI-medtop.xml - KI-medtop.json 
* IPTC Scene codes, about 20 terms as a flat list: KI-scene.xml - KI-scene.json
