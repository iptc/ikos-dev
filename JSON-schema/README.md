#IKOS' native JSON - IPTC format for Concepts and Schemes


The IPTC Concepts and Controlled Vocabularies can be expressed by a native JSON format, having the terms defined by W3C SKOS and [IKOS](http://dev.iptc.org/IKOS) as background.

For IPTC's native JSON format two JSON Schemas are available (for both are PDFs as documentation available):

- IKOS-concept-schema-0.2.json as Schema of a Concepts
- IKOS-scheme-schema-0.2.json as Schema of the Concept Scheme (equivalant to a Knowledge Item)

The samples sub-folder provides one example.
