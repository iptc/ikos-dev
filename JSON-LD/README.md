# JSON-LD using W3C SKOS and IKOS

The IPTC Concepts and Controlled Vocabularies can be expressed by using the W3C SKOS and IKOS as JSON-LD graph: the @context object of the IKOS.jsonld file must be integrated into a native JSON object (see the /JSON-schema folder). This small action makes a valid JSON-LD document out of it - see the samples sub-folder.
